## Announcement

This workshop will give you the opportunity to practice git as a version control system
and Github as a website to host your repositories. Using git you can track changes in
folders. It allows you track your progress and to spot random typos when working on
many projects and tasks in parallel. In the workshop you will get the time to practice
the fundamental concepts and actions directly in your browser - either using VSCode in
GitHub Codespaces or in using the GitHub web interface. If you want, you can also try
everything on your local computer.

I will give a brief introduction to git. Then you will specific workflows by
collaboratively work on extending a [recipe book](https://enryh.github.io/recipe-book/)
(please bring a recipe you like).
You will learn how to work on
[branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches),
review [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
and merge them into the main branch. If you have specific requests, feel free to reach out to me.
