# Use cases for git and GitHub

Two examples:

 - VueGen reporting tool
 - shared notes repository of Data Science Platform

## Keep track of changes locally

- if you code, you can keep an eye on your changes. Highlight current differences in
  your way forward to a solution. Especially usefull when working with Coding Assistents
  based on AI which rewrite your code

## Collaborate with others and keep changes in sync

- Google Docs, Word or Overleaf is used to work collaborative on manuscripts
- GitHub and git can be used to do the same on public documentation or code
