# Use cases for git and GitHub

Two examples:

- VueGen reporting tool - [VueGen repo](https://github.com/Multiomics-Analytics-Group/vuegen)
- shared notes repository of Data Science Platform - [DSP notes repo](https://github.com/biosustain/dsp_notes)
- publish analysis code and results ('code availability') - [not just another biomarker repo](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/njab)

## Keep track of changes locally

- if you code, you can keep an eye on your changes. Highlight current differences in
  your way forward to a solution. Especially usefull when working with Coding Assistents
  based on AI which rewrite your code

## Collaborate with others and keep changes in sync

- Google Docs, Word or Overleaf is used to work collaborative on manuscripts
- GitHub and git can be used to do the same on public documentation or code
